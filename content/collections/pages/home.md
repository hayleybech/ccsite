          Choir Concierge is a passion project started by Australian software developer and music lover Hayley Bech. As a choir director and music team member for multiple choirs, Hayley has had the opportunity to work with the majority of popular choir management apps on the market, learning what is important for choir management and what could be improved upon.

          Choir Concierge was born out of a desire to create a choir management tool that was powerful, but also incredibly simple. The product was designed with user experience as the top priority.

          After 7+ years of development, we are proud to be able to share with you our software. We truly believe it is a cutting-edge solution that won’t just help you manage your choir, but will also be easy to use while doing it.
