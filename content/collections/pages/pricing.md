        heading: 'Thank you for supporting Choir Concierge'
        description: |-
          Choir Concierge is truly a labor of love for me, born from my experiences as a choir director and my passion for music.

          For over two decades, music has been the constant thread that brings meaning to my life - from over a decade performing in lead roles in local musical theatre companies to 11+ years of singing in award-winning choirs with Barbershop Harmony Australia. Along the way, I've worn many hats: singer, coach, Director/AMD, and even founder of my own vocal coaching business.

          Over this time, I've also seen firsthand how admin tasks can steal time from what we all love most: making music. That's how my two passions - music and technology - collided. With over a decade of experience as a software developer, I realised I could create something to help choirs focus more on the joy of singing and less on administrative headaches.

          That's why for the past 7+ years, I've poured my heart into developing Choir Concierge. My goal has always been to create a tool that I wish I'd had all those years ago - something that truly understands what choirs need, a tool that's both powerful and incredibly simple to use.

          Your support means the world to me. You're not just using a product; you're helping to bring a dream to life.

          I hope Choir Concierge exceeds your expectations and makes your choir management experience smoother and more enjoyable.
